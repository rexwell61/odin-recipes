    <h1>Christmas Breakfast Casserole</h1>
    <img src="Casserole.jpg">
    <p>There’s nothing better than putting together an easy breakfast casserole in the morning and <br>
        just popping it in the oven, especially during the holidays. When you’re so busy baking Christmas <br>
        cookies and planning your Christmas dinner menu, who has time to spend on making a made-to-order <br>
        breakfast, too?! That’s why this Christmas Breakfast Casserole is the best ever. It's packed <br>
        with gooey cheese, rich croissants, ham, and peppers and is sure to be the hit of your holiday morning.</p>

     <p><strong>Can you make Christmas Breakfast Casserole vegetarian?</strong><br>
        Yes! You can leave out the ham in this casserole and it will still be <br>
        full of cheesy goodness for any non-meat eaters in your family.</p>
        
    <p><strong>How long will leftovers last?</strong><br>
        We recommend eating any leftovers within two days of cooking the casserole.</p>
        
     <p><strong>Can you use bacon instead of ham in this breakfast casserole?</strong><br>
        Yes! Bacon would be a delicious substitute for the ham. Just use the same <br>
        amount of chopped cooked bacon (you may want to adjust the amount of salt, <br>
        though, since bacon can often be saltier than ham).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <uL>
              <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
              <li>8 oz. deli ham, diced</li>
              <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
              <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
              <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
              <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
              <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
              <li>1 tsp. fresh thyme, chopped</li>
              <li>6 croissants, cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces</li>
              <li>1 c. milk</li>
              <li>3/4 c. half-and-half</li>
              <li>1 tsp. hot sauce</li>
              <li>5 large eggs</li>
              <li>2 c. grated white cheddar cheese</li>
              <li>1 c. grated pepper jack cheese</li>
            </uL>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over <br>
                medium-high heat. Add the ham, onion and bell peppers and <br>
                cook, stirring, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the salt, <br>
                pepper and thyme and cook for 1 more minute. <br>
                Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. </li>
            <li>Brush a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with the remaining 1 <br>
                tablespoon olive oil. Add the croissant pieces, top with the ham <br>
                mixture and mix gently to combine. </li>
            <li>Whisk together the milk, half-and-half, hot sauce and eggs <br>
                in a medium bowl. Add half of both cheeses. Pour the mixture <br>
                over the croissants and mix gently to combine <br>
                and evenly distribute. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour <br>
                and up to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚. Remove the casserole from the <br>
                refrigerator, uncover and let sit at room temperature for 15 <br>
                minutes before baking, pressing down on the croissants <br>
                with a spatula to make sure they are well soaked. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese. <br>
                Bake until puffed, golden brown and the cheese is melted, <br>
                about 45 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>

    <h1>Chicken Taco Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="lasagna.jpg">
    <p>I’m sure everyone has their own favorite go-to lasagna recipe, but I’d just like to offer <br>
        that this really is The Best Lasagna Ever. Growing up, my mom and her friends used to make it for <br>
        potlucks and gatherings, and part of its appeal is that the ingredients used are totally basic; <br>
        you don’t have to hunt down fresh basil or buffalo mozzarella or Parmigiano-Reggiano or handmade <br>
        sausage from an Italian mama in old Napoli. Anyone can make this, anywhere, anytime. And it’s the easiest thing in the world.</p>

       <p>Aside from the simplicity and availability of ingredients, however, this lasagna is just dadgum good.</p>
        
       <p>I’ve made this lasagna for various categories of humans since my mom first scribbled it down <br>
        for me: men, women, democrats, republicans, scholars, and foreign dignitaries. I even donated <br>
        two pans to a charity auction once. The overwhelming consensus has always been that it’s <br>
        "The Best Lasagna Ever," which is precisely what I’ve been trying to tell you turkeys. <br>
        So let’s get started!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
           <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
           <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
           <li>2 cans (14.5 ounce) whole tomatoes</li>
           <li>2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
           <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
           <li>2 tbsp. dried basil</li>
           <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
           <li>3 c. lowfat cottage cheese</li>
           <li>2 whole beaten eggs</li>
           <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) Parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
           <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
           <li>1 package (10 ounce) lasagna noodles</li>
           <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or <br>
                saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. <br>
                Cook over medium-high heat until browned. <br>
                Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, <br>
                tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. <br>
                After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture <br>
                should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on <br>
                the other steps.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, <br>
                grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon <br>
                salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon <br>
                salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, <br>
                then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom <br>
                of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half <br>
                the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. <br>
                Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. <br>
                Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture <br>
                over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle <br>
                top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
                <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or <br>
                    bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, <br>
                    or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
